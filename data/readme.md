# BUGS
✓ Item stats would re-apply on everyones main hand when a player would hold an item that didn't have stats yet
NOTE: This allowed for items such as food or blocks to have stats
FIX: Now executes as a player on itself + changed the item_modifier to replace the stat [This migh be useful for when you make an option to re-apply the stats]

✓ Ysembert talks to everyone on the server + it spawns multiple times in an area
FIX: Ysembert only spawns once per 32 blocks + only talks to the player that is talking to him [makes use of predicate looking_at]

✓ Ysembert leaves early
FIX: Now sets the timer back to 500t each time you ask a question

✓ Ysembert doesn't work in survival
FIX: Uses trigger instead of function so it is survival friendly + only executes as the player

# TO-DO

✓ better rng system
✓ stat pitty system
✓  ┗ PITY based on usefullness
