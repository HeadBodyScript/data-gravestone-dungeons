I possess a vast array of enchantments, wrought from the ancient and mysterious corners of the Lands Beyond. From simple, yet useful, charms to those of a far more powerful nature, I offer them to you for a fair price. I have sorted these enchantments into four distinct categories, each more potent than the last: uncommon, rare, epic and legendary. Last are the rarest of the rare, these enchantments are a treasure indeed. I do not possess a single example myself, but perhaps you may find them hidden within the deepest, uncleared dungeons of the world.\nShould you wish to trade, my friend, do let me know. A fair exchange of knowledge and treasures is always a pleasure."}]

These groups, with their own mysterious ways, imbue their equipment with enchantments of great power. Yet, they do not share their secrets, and their methods remain unknown.\nIf, by fortune or skill, you should lay hands on such enchanted gear, I implore you, treat it as a treasure beyond measure. For the enchantments bestowed upon such items are not to be found in the wares of any trader, and as far as I know, no merchant has ever offered such equipment for sale."}]

These masters bound their enchantments into ancient books and scrolls, their power stretching far beyond the reach of what we can even begin to fathom in this age. Their methods were meticulous, complex, and deeply woven with the very fabric of magic itself.\nAlas, the passage of time has claimed these secrets, and the knowledge that once fueled such mighty enchantments has been lost to history. I am no longer acquainted with any wizard who holds the ability to weave such powerful spells into physical form. The art has faded, and now only echoes remain of what once was."}]

I traveled far and wide, through bustling cities, hidden forests, and ancient ruins. Along the way, I began to write\u2014descriptions of places I had visited, of the landscapes and people I encountered.\nBut now, the years have caught up with me, and my legs have grown tired. Now, I rely on the tales of brave adventurers, whose journeys bring the far-flung corners of the world to my doorstep. I take their stories, and with the help of my quill, I turn their words into writings\u2014preserving their experiences.\nIf you are planning to venture to one of the places I have written about, you are welcome to peruse my collection. Within these pages, you may find a bit of guidance for your own travels."}]

Rising proudly atop the ruins of an ancient temple, it serves as a testament to the resilience of those who rebuilt in the aftermath of such devastation. The original temple, though, is no more, its entrances sealed off, lest we disturb the souls who still rest within. The spirits of the old world remain undisturbed, their lives lost to the depths of time.\nThere are rumors, that hidden caves still wind their way toward the heart of the temple, deep beneath the keep. Perhaps in the forgotten corners of the earth, some passageway remains unsealed. But, alas, I came to this place in my later years, when my body had grown tired and my bones could no longer bear the weight of such adventures. No spelunking for me, my friend. But do not speak of this to the Jarl or the Vogt. They fear that should something stir beneath, we may not be prepared to face it. Best leave the past undisturbed, for now."}]
