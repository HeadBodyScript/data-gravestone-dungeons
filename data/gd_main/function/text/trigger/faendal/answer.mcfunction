Listen well, and mark my words, for I will not waste breath repeating them:\nThe Lands Beyond are steeped in history, marked by the bones of old empires and ruins left shattered by the Great War. Though stone crumbles and banners rot, whispers tell of evils that linger yet, unseen and unspoken.\nShould you possess wit and patience, the tools we provide may serve you well\u2014be it in trade or craft. There is coin to be made and a name to forge, if you keep your hands steady and your ambitions sharp.\nBut hear this warning, and hear it clear: too many young fools take to wandering these lands, chasing glory and quick silver. They are neither skilled in the art of war nor clad in gear fit for survival. Most vanish into the wilds, swallowed whole by the dark and the forgotten.\nDo yourself the favor they did not. Keep clear of such cursed grounds unless you are armed, armored, and thrice prepared. I have spoken my warning. My duty is fulfilled. What you do beyond this is your own folly."}]

In those dark days, the old gods themselves called upon the human kings to stand with them against the shadows spilling forth from the Shadowlands. And stand they did\u2014but consider the price.\nWhere once mighty kingdoms ruled, now lie only crumbled stones and dust, buried beneath the weight of time and sorrow. The knowledge of our ancestors is all but lost, and with it, countless marvels of craft and war\u2014left to rot beneath the soil or locked within the ruins you no doubt seek to plunder.\nBut these ruins are not abandoned. No, far from it. They bristle with traps long set and beasts twisted by ancient magics. Worse still, every great dungeon holds a guardian\u2014an eternal sentinel of flesh or steel, tasked with slaying any fool who enters without proper preparation.\nSo take this counsel and take it seriously: unless you are fully equipped and know your craft well, stay away. Let the treasures of the old world lie untouched a while longer. Gold and glory will wait. The grave will not."}]

So be it.\nListen closely, then. The dungeon guardians are no common beasts. They strike with brutal force, and their reach is long\u2014few who enter their domain live long enough to regret it. Each of these creatures, these so-called \"bosses,\" fights with a distinct and deadly style. Some wield dark sorcery. Others, sharpened steel. Some move like wind, others like mountains. If you step into their lairs unprepared, you'll not step out again.\nIf you seek even a chance of survival, visit Zaccarius. His library crowns the main tower, and within it lie what records remain of these cursed places. Maps. Accounts. Weaknesses, if the scribes have recorded true. Study them well. Knowledge may serve you longer than any blade.\nNow... if by some miracle you manage to slay one of these guardians and return with proof of your triumph, I will see you well paid for the deed. Direwood Keep rewards strength and results, not empty boasts.\nAnd should the gods grant you the appetite for more, know this: bandits and witches infest these lands like rot. They raid our roads, poison our wells, and sow chaos where order once stood. Bring me proof of their deaths, and I shall make it worth your while."}]

The more who join the fray, the greater their fury. Their strength swells, their attacks sharpen, and their ranks of minions multiply to match. What begins as a battle may well become a war.\nAnd mind this as well: the difficulty you have chosen to face in this realm\u2014whether by your own pride or foolish ambition\u2014will weigh heavily upon such encounters. The higher you set the stakes, the deadlier the game becomes. Choose wisely how you intend to engage, and prepare twice over.\nStill, while greater numbers may rouse the beast\u2019s ire, a skilled ally is worth any price. Coordination, discipline, and steel held steady\u2014these may tip the scales where raw numbers do not. A helping hand, if well chosen, can be the difference between victory and your name carved on the gravestones beyond my walls."}]

Such a fool sometimes.\nDuring the war, when the gods still walked among us, entire guilds and great orders devoted themselves to forging weapons of terrible power. They sought victory at any cost. And they paid the price in blood. Many of the master smiths and enchanters perished, taking their knowledge to the grave. What they once knew\u2014how they shaped steel and bound magic\u2014we have not recovered since.\nYet the remnants of their work endure. Hidden in the ruins, buried beneath centuries of stone and ash, there remain artifacts of that forgotten craft. Weapons and armor enchanted beyond what any forge today could hope to produce. Some serve as passive boons\u2014wards of protection, whispers of speed, or wells of endurance. Others unleash ruin upon the battlefield, capable of destruction few now alive could comprehend.\nAnd mark me well: should you uncover a full set of such gear, their combined power grows yet greater. Synergy between them unlocks abilities we dare not speak of openly. In the wrong hands, such relics could topple keeps and kingdoms alike."}]

Step there, and should the gods favor your presence, you may find yourself bolstered in strength, fleet of foot, or graced with prolonged vitality. Yet, should their favor wane, you will feel their wrath most keenly. None can fathom the scale by which the gods dispense their rewards or punishments.\nFor further understanding of these arcane junctures, seek the counsel of our court wizard, Alaric. His mastery of the mystical arts may yet shed light upon these secrets."}]
