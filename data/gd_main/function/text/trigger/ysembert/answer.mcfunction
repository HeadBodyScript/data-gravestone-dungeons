'Tis what the traders deal in, naught else. Most folk have needs aplenty, and they'll pay fair for what fills their coffers. But if ye've a keen eye and a strong arm, ye might find a fair bit yourself, tucked away in dusty chests, or pried from the hands of some wretched outlaw ye've bested on the road. But mark me words, many have tried, and many more will, but ye can't forge coin with yer own hands. Gold and silver in their raw form may have worth, aye, but a coin bears more than its weight, it bears trust. A stamped piece is worth more than its measure in iron or gold nuggets, for it carries the seal of the realm, and that, my friend, is a thing not so easily crafted."}]

Ye'll find most o' them settlin' in villages or near castles, where the coin flows and folk have needs aplenty. Ye'll come across all manner o' traders offerin' goods, be it supplies, gear, or even mounts, if yer purse is heavy enough. But these traders, they're not just sellin', they're buyin' too, always lookin' for resources to craft their specialities based on their trade. If ye're lookin' to make a name for yerself, the road to riches might be in settin' up a business and sellin' yer goods to 'em. They restock their wares once or twice a day, so always keep that in mind when yer dealin' with them. And then, there's the gypsy merchants. They wander the plains and forests, always movin' from place to place. They'll sell ye anything yer heart desires, but I'd say their prices are a bit steep for my taste. Still, if ye need somethin' quick and ain't got the time to haggle, they're an option, I suppose."}]

I've stumbled upon a fair few such places myself. Feels queer, like a tingle in the bones if ye kneel there, ha! They call them Arcane Nodes, where two or more magical power-lines cross, often found around the ruins of bygone days. But as for how it all works? Bah, I'm no mage. If ye seek wisdom on such matters, best speak with a learned soul, like Alaric Stormweaver, the court wizard of Direwood Keep. He knows more of such mysteries than I ever could."}]

I told ye before, I've never quite wrapped my head thround it. Our court wizard, Alaric, tried explainin' it to me once, but I reckon I was a touch too deep in my cups for such a lesson. From what I recall, there be more than one way to wield this magicka, as he calls it. Some enchantments draw power from the weapon itself, less potent, mayhap, but steady. Others pull straight from the caster, which I reckon makes them stronger, if ye've the gift for it. But don't take my word for it, go see Alaric yerself. If ye've got a spark o' magic in ye, he'll have much more to say on the matter than I ever could."}]

Well, let me tell ye, I count meself fast friends with the Silverhand family, the finest smiths in Direwood Keep, and that's no small boast. Been hammerin' steel for generations, they have! Three brothers run the forge now, each a master of his own craft. They've a grand house, a mighty blast furnace, and a shop brimming with steel fit for a king's guard. If ye seek to arm yerself proper, best pay them a visit. From what I've seen of yer gear, theirs is hardier, lighter, and bites deeper in a fight.

My old man tried teachin' me as a lad, but it seems my hands and eyes can't quite agree on the matter. But if archery's yer fancy, ye'd do well to seek out Ragnar, our fletcher at the keep. He knows all there is to know about the craft. Now, if ye've a mind for makin' yer own, ye can try craftin' strong arrows yerself, though ye'll likely start with the usual flint-tipped ones. But for arrows with more finesse, ye'll need to speak with a proper fletcher, or buy them from their stock. They've got some fine wares, I'll tell ye that. And if ye're after a bow that'll last the ages, they've crafted some beauties, crossbows too, that'll outlive the run-of-the-mill bows most folk use.

The lands be rich with fine breeders, most settlin' near the great keeps and towns, makes sense, aye? They rear all manner of mounts, sturdy horses, hardy donkeys, and even camels in the hotter reaches, so I've heard. Each breed has its purpose, whether for speed, endurance, or sheer strength. But here's the best part, our craftsmen make some of the finest saddles and horse armor ye'll find. A well-fitted saddle can make a beast swifter and steadier, and good armor grants them endurance enough to ride through the harshest trials. Most breeders sell such gear, but if ye fancy a bit of adventure, there's no tellin' what treasures lie locked away in the chests of forgotten dungeons, some relics of the old age, mayhap. And if ye've a mind to learn the secrets of fine breeding, well share a mug of ale with a breeder or two. A loose tongue and a friendly ear can go a long way."}]

And let me tell ye, all across this land, ye'll find cooks whippin' up dishes that'll make yer stomach sing! From the finest stews to the richest meads, they've got it all. Sure, the ingredients might be rare and costly, but they sell it at prices that won't gut yer purse too much. I remember the first time I had a hearty beef stew, washed down with a mug o' mead. Felt like fire runnin' through my veins, a strength I'd never known before. Now, ye could try cookin' it yerself, but gatherin' the right ingredients takes time, some of them only come from rare animals, and even then, they don't turn up often. But here's the thing, if yer mouth's waterin', don't go wastin' time. Just find a cook who knows his craft, hand them some prime cuts, and they'll work magic ye couldn't hope to match. Trust me, they'll do a better job than ye ever could. And oh, the joys of goatmeat, Mmmm, it's as delicious as it is hearty."}]

If ye come across such items, be they old relics or curios dropped by undead grave guardians, wraiths, or ghosts, I don't rightly know the difference, but I know the worth when I see it, bring them to me. I'll make it worth yer while. And if ye happen upon rare pelts or hides, say, from those curious mushroom cows, sly foxes, or the mighty bears that roam the land, bring those too.

In those long, bitter winters when the cold gnaws at yer bones, it's their songs and tales that warm the heart. Stories of mighty heroes and fair princesses in distress, they make the bleakest days feel a touch lighter. There was a bard by the name of Cedric who settled in Direwood Keep. Always strummin' a tune, fillin' the air with joyous sounds. But of late, he's gone missin'. Told me he fancied wanderin' through some caves, reckons there's a whole underground world to discover, full of new stories for his songs. Haven't seen him since. I like to think he's off livin' his tales, but maybe he's just over at Edinborough Fair, joinin' with Elana, another bard, this season. Ha!

But if ye seek answers, yer better off askin' Gilbert Silverhand or Alaric Stormweaver, they know more about them than I ever will. As for me, well... they give me a chill. Those things were forged in the fires of war, and I'm not so sure it's wise to mess with them. Not sure if it's safe to touch them, or keep them about the house.

Might be useful in a pinch, but they're fools if ye ask me, workin' for a purse instead of a purpose. But if coin's worth the circus, well, it's their choice, not mine. There are others, though, the more magical sorts. Some fight with strange and wondrous abilities. The Cloud Nomads, for instance, they craft powerful golems, big, sturdy beasts that plow through enemy ranks like a storm. Mighty fine fighters, but I warn ye, they cost a pretty penny. Then there are the wizards, the ones who sell lesser spells, scrolls, mostly, that let ye summon companions when ye need 'em. Handy for those times when ye're clearin' a dungeon or facin' an enemy bigger than yer blade. It's not my way, but some folk find them mighty useful."}]

Keep yer eyes open, and ye'll find 'em, big or small, deep or steep, whole or in ruin, ha ha ha! Now, smaller dungeons, well most o' those are plundered clean or left to rot, empty as a hollow chest. But there be some still roamin' with beasts or undead guards, poor souls who died long ago and still fight on, trapped in their endless afterlife, seein' all who enter as trespassers. Some larger dungeons, though, are inhabited by folk, usually those who've made a home out of the ruins. And if ye wander too deep, ye might stumble upon a place built around an Arcane Node. Powerful energy, aye, but dangerous. Some wizards got their hands on such power, and it drove them mad. So, if ye wander those halls, be wary, what seems empty might be far from it. I never dared set foot in such places meself, but I've heard tales from frightened adventurers. The deeper ye go, the greater the treasures, they say, but also the dangers. There's always at least one powerful guardian lurking in the depths. And, mark me, the stewards of the castles pay handsomely if ye can bring proof ye've cleared such threats from their lands. But don't get cocky, young adventurer! Most who face these dungeons never return. It ain't for the faint of heart, that's for sure."}]
