But if you're lookin' for something more specialized, I can provide just that. I\u2019ve got short ponies, perfect for navigatin\u2019 dense forests and smaller caves, though they\u2019re not as enduring as some others. Or if you're in need of a true workhorse, I\u2019ve got large northern drafts\u2014they\u2019re built for heavy labor, with incredible stamina and surprisingly swift for their size. Now, if you\u2019re travelin' to warmer southern lands, you might come across traders sellin' camels. These beasts are trained to be twice as fast as their wild cousins, making them ideal for long, swift journeys across the heat."}]

Those rare treasures are dropped when a mystical horse meets its end. You\u2019ll only find \u2018em in the Molten Abyss, a place as dangerous as it sounds. If you're lookin' to know more, your best bet is to pay a visit to the court wizard, Alaric Stormweaver. He usually hangs around his house just down the street.\nNow, I buy those mystical hearts from him\u2014don\u2019t come cheap, I\u2019ll tell ya that. I use \u2018em to enhance the stats of my newborn horses. Took me some time, but I got pretty skilled at it. If you\u2019ve got one of those hearts, you can use it near a young mount, and it\u2019ll work its magic to improve it. But, don\u2019t bother with an adult mount\u2014once they\u2019re fully grown, they can\u2019t be shaped any more. Only the foals have that potential."}]

Once you\u2019ve worked your magic on a foal, it won\u2019t be able to improve any further, as the magic can\u2019t be applied twice. After that, you can tame it as an adult mount, and it\u2019ll be yours.\nSadly, the magic doesn\u2019t carry over from the parents, no matter how strong or well-bred they are. The enchantment only affects fresh-born mounts. It\u2019s a bit of a finicky process, but when you see the results in a young mount, it\u2019s worth the effort. And like me, you\u2019ll find that the quality tends to improve with each foal you enhance."}]

Listen closely: The saddles I sell are designed to make your mount faster and allow it to jump higher, thanks to their lightweight construction. You won\u2019t find anything else that gives your steed that kind of agility.\nAs for the horse armor, though it\u2019s made from sturdy iron and steel, don\u2019t worry\u2014it won\u2019t slow your mount down. It provides solid protection and even boosts your mount\u2019s health by a fair amount. If you\u2019re lookin\u2019 to get yourself a real warhorse, this is the kind of armor you\u2019ll need.\nBut I won\u2019t sugarcoat it: these things don\u2019t come cheap, mainly because of the quality of materials I use. The choice is yours, of course, and I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s best for you, but I\u2019d suggest you try them out for yourself and see the difference. You won\u2019t regret it once you do."}]

But between you and me\u2014there\u2019s no doubt that the artisans of the great war forged equipment far beyond what we can create now. Sadly, that knowledge has been lost to time. The finest of their works are now scattered and hidden, lying in forgotten graves and ruined buildings.\nIf you happen to stumble upon such gear in your travels, come and show me. I'd love to see a horse armored in such legendary craftsmanship at least once in my life. It\u2019d be a sight to behold, I reckon."}]
